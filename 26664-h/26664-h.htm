<h3 class="smcap">Scene 1</h3>

<div class="scene"><p>Prot&aacute;sov's<a name="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> flat in Moscow. The scene represents a small
dining-room.</p>

<p>Anna P&aacute;vlovna, a stout grey-haired lady, tightly laced, is
sitting alone at the tea-table on which is a samov&aacute;r. Enter
nurse, carrying a teapot.</p></div>

<p><span class="speaker">NURSE.</span> May I have a little hot water, ma'am?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Yes. How's Baby?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NURSE.</span> He's restless.&hellip; There's nothing worse than
for a lady to nurse her baby herself! She has her
troubles, and the child must suffer. What can her milk
be like, when she lies awake crying all night?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> But she seems quieter now.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NURSE.</span> Quiet, indeed! It makes one ill to see her.
She's been writing something, and crying.</p>

<p><i>Enter S&aacute;sha.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">S&Aacute;SHA</span> [<i>to Nurse</i>] Lisa is looking for you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NURSE.</span> I'm coming, I'm coming. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p>ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA. Nurse says she keeps on crying.&hellip;
Why can't she control herself?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">S&Aacute;SHA.</span> Well really, mother, you are amazing!&hellip; A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234">234</a></span>woman has left her husband, her child's father, and you
expect her to be calm!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Well, not calm &hellip; But what's done
is done! If I, her mother, not only allowed my daughter
to leave her husband, but am even glad she has done it,
that shows he deserved it. One ought to rejoice, not to
grieve, at the chance of freeing oneself from such a bad
man!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">S&Aacute;SHA.</span> Mother, why say such things? You know it's
not true! He's not bad&mdash;but on the contrary, he's a
wonderful man, in spite of his weaknesses.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Yes indeed, a &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; man&mdash;as
soon as he has money in his pocket&mdash;his own or other
people's.&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">S&Aacute;SHA.</span> Mother! He has never taken other people's!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Yes he has&mdash;his wife's! Where's the
difference?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">S&Aacute;SHA.</span> But he gave all his property to his wife!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Of course, when he knew that otherwise
he was sure to squander it all!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">S&Aacute;SHA.</span> Squander or not, I only know that a wife must
not separate from her husband, especially from such a
one as F&eacute;dya.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Then, in your opinion she ought to
wait till he has squandered everything, and brought his
gipsy mistresses into the house?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">S&Aacute;SHA.</span> He has no mistresses!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> That's the misfortune&mdash;he seems to
have bewitched you all! But not me&mdash;no! He won't
come over me! I see through him, and he knows it.
Had I been in Lisa's place I should have left him a
year ago.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">S&Aacute;SHA.</span> How lightly you say it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Not lightly at all. It's not a light
thing for me, as a mother, to see my daughter divorced.
Believe me it's not! But yet it is better than ruining a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235">235</a></span>young life.&hellip; No, I'm thankful to God that she has
at last made up her mind, and that it is all over.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">S&Aacute;SHA.</span> Perhaps it's not all over!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Oh! If he only consents to a divorce.&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">S&Aacute;SHA.</span> What good will that do?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> This good; that she is young, and may
again be happy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">S&Aacute;SHA.</span> Oh mother! It's dreadful to hear you speak so!
Lisa can't love another.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Why not, when she's free? Many a
man a thousand times better than your F&eacute;dya might turn
up who would be only too happy to marry Lisa.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">S&Aacute;SHA.</span> Mother, it's not right! I know you're thinking
of Victor Kar&eacute;nin.&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> And why shouldn't I? He has loved
her these ten years, and she loves him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">S&Aacute;SHA.</span> Yes, but not as a husband! They have been
friends from childhood.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> We know those friendships! If only
the obstacles were out of the way!</p>

<p><i>Enter Maid.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> What is it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MAID.</span> The mistress has sent the porter with a note for
Mr. Kar&eacute;nin.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> What mistress?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MAID.</span> <em>Our</em> mistress&mdash;Mrs. Prot&aacute;sova.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MAID.</span> Mr. Kar&eacute;nin has sent back word that he will
come round at once.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA</span> [<i>surprised</i>] We were just speaking of
him! Only I can't think why &hellip; [<i>to S&aacute;sha</i>] Do you
know?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">S&Aacute;SHA.</span> Perhaps I do, and perhaps I don't!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> You always have secrets!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">S&Aacute;SHA.</span> Lisa will tell you herself when she comes.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA</span> [<i>shakes her head. To Maid</i>] The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236">236</a></span>samov&aacute;r must be made to boil again. Take it, Douny&aacute;sha.</p>

<p><i>Maid takes samov&aacute;r, and exit.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA</span> [<i>to S&aacute;sha who has risen and is going out</i>]
It turns out just as I told you! She sent for him at
once.&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">S&Aacute;SHA.</span> She may have sent for him for quite a different
reason.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> What for, then?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">S&Aacute;SHA.</span> Now, at this moment, Kar&eacute;nin is the same to
her as old Nurse Tr&iacute;fonovna.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Well, you'll see.&hellip; Don't I know
her? She has sent for him to comfort her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">S&Aacute;SHA.</span> Oh mother, how little you know her, to be able
to suppose&nbsp;&hellip;!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Well, we'll see!&hellip; And I am very,
very glad.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">S&Aacute;SHA.</span> We <em>shall</em> see! [<i>Exit, humming a tune</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA</span> [<i>alone, shakes her head and mutters</i>] It's
all right, it's all right!</p>

<p><i>Enter Maid.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">MAID.</span> Mr. Kar&eacute;nin has come.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Well then, show him in, and tell your
mistress.</p>

<p><i>Maid exit by inner door. Enter Kar&eacute;nin, who bows to
Anna P&aacute;vlovna.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> Your daughter wrote to me to come. I
meant to come and see you to-night, anyhow. So I was
very pleased &hellip; Is Elisabeth Andr&eacute;yevna<a name="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> well?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Yes, she is well, but Baby is a bit restless.
She will be here directly. [<i>In a melancholy voice</i>]
Ah yes! It is a sad time.&hellip; But you know all about
it, don't you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> I do. I was here, you know, the day before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237">237</a></span>yesterday, when his letter came. But is it possible that
everything is irrevocably settled?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Why of course! Naturally! To go
through it all again would be intolerable.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> This is a case where the proverb applies:
&ldquo;Measure ten times before you cut once.&rdquo; &hellip; It is very
painful to cut into the quick.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Of course it is; but then their marriage
has long had a rift in it, so that the tearing asunder was
easier than one would have thought. He himself sees
that, after what has occurred, it is impossible for him to
return.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> Why so?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> How can you expect it, after all his
horrid goings-on&mdash;after he swore it should not happen
again, and that if it did he would renounce all rights as
a husband and set her perfectly free?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> Yes, but how can a woman be free when she
is bound by marriage?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> By divorce. He promised her a
divorce, and we shall insist on it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> Yes, but Elisabeth Andr&eacute;yevna loved him
so.&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Ah, but her love has suffered such
trials that there can hardly be anything left of it!
Drunkenness, deception, and infidelity &hellip; Can one
love such a husband?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> Nothing is impossible to love.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> You talk of love! But how can one
love such a man&mdash;a broken reed, whom one can never
depend on? Don't you know what it came to&nbsp;&hellip;?
[<i>Looks round at the door, and continues hurriedly</i>] All his
affairs in a muddle, everything pawned, nothing to pay
with! Then their uncle sends 2,000 roubles to pay the
interest on their mortgaged estates, and he takes the
money and disappears. His wife is left at home, with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238">238</a></span>sick baby, waiting for him&mdash;and at last gets a note asking
her to send him his clothes and things!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> Yes, yes; I know.</p>

<p><i>Enter Lisa and S&aacute;sha.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Well, here is Victor Mih&aacute;ylovich,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
obedient to your summons.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> Yes, but I am sorry I was delayed for a few
minutes.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> Thank you. I have a great favour to ask of you,
and I have no one to turn to but you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> Anything in my power&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> You know all about&nbsp;&hellip;?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> I do.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Well then, I shall leave you [<i>To
S&aacute;sha</i>] Come, we'll leave them alone. [<i>Exit with S&aacute;sha</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> Yes, he wrote to me saying that he considers
everything at an end &hellip; [<i>struggling with her tears</i>] &hellip;
and I was hurt!&hellip; and so &hellip; In a word, I consented
to break&mdash;I answered, accepting his renunciation.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> And now you repent?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> Yes. I feel that I was wrong, and that I cannot
do it. Anything is better than to be separated from him.
In short&mdash;I want you to give him this letter.&hellip; Please,
Victor, give him the letter, and tell him &hellip; and bring
him back!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN</span> [<i>surprised</i>] Yes, but how?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> Tell him I ask him to forget everything, and to
return. I might simply send the letter, but I know him:
his first impulse, as always, will be the right one&mdash;but
then someone will influence him, and he'll change his
mind and not do what he really wants to.&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> I will do what I can.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> You're surprised at my asking <em>you</em>?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> No.&hellip; Yet, to tell you the truth&mdash;yes, I
am surprised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239">239</a></span>
<span class="speaker">LISA.</span> But you are not angry?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> As if I could be angry with you!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> I asked you because I know you care for him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> Him, and you too! You know that. I am
thinking not of myself, but of you. Thank you for
trusting me! I will do what I can.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> I know.&hellip; I will tell you everything. To-day
I went to Afr&eacute;mov's to find out where he was. I
was told he had gone to the gipsies&mdash;which is what I
feared most of all. I know he will get carried away if
he is not stopped in time&mdash;and that's what has to be
done.&hellip; So you'll go?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> Of course, and at once.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> Go!&hellip; Find him, and tell him all is forgotten
and I am waiting for him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> But where am I to look for him?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> He is with the gipsies. I went there myself.&hellip;
I went as far as the porch, and wished to send in the
letter, but changed my mind and decided to ask you.
Here is the address.&hellip; Well, then, tell him to return:
tell him nothing has happened &hellip; all is forgotten. Do
it for love of him, and for the sake of our friendship!</p>

he was a little better he at once began to smile and crow.
I must go to him, but I don't like leaving you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> You had better have a cup of tea, and eat
something.</p>

so glum about?&hellip; I gave him the money quite
well, and he took it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">S&Aacute;SHA.</span> It's disgusting! She has taken him with her to
the nursery. It's just as if he were her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fianc&eacute;</i> or her

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Whatever does it matter to you? Why

him yourself?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">S&Aacute;SHA.</span> I? Marry that pikestaff? I'd rather marry I
don't know whom, than him! Such a thing never entered
my head.&hellip; I am only disgusted that, after F&eacute;dya,
Lisa can be so attracted by a stranger.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Not a stranger, but an old playfellow!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">S&Aacute;SHA.</span> Don't I see by their smiles and looks that they
are in love?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Well, what is there to be surprised at
in that? He shares her anxiety about her baby, shows
sympathy and helps her &hellip; and she feels grateful.
Besides, why should she not love and marry Victor?</p>

you would certainly have done as I did, and have gone

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> Well then, listen, S&aacute;sha.&hellip; It's true that I
am her husband and the father of her child, but I am&mdash;superfluous!
Wait, wait&mdash;don't reply.&hellip; You think
I'm jealous? Not at all! In the first place, I have no
right; secondly, I have no cause. Victor Kar&eacute;nin is her
old friend and mine too. He loves her, and she him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">S&Aacute;SHA.</span> No!</p>

does not allow herself to love anyone but her husband.

they shall be happy! [<i>His voice trembles</i>].</p>

<div class="scene">
<p>Prince Abr&eacute;zkov, a sixty-year-old bachelor with moustaches,
a retired army man, elegant, very dignified and melancholy-looking.
Anna Dm&iacute;trievna Kar&eacute;nina (Victor's mother), a fifty-year-old
&ldquo;grande dame&rdquo; who tries to appear younger, and
intersperses her remarks with French expressions.</p>

<p>Anna Dm&iacute;trievna's sitting-room, furnished with expensive
simplicity, and filled with souvenirs.</p>

<p>Anna Dm&iacute;trievna is writing. Footman enters.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="speaker">FOOTMAN.</span> Prince Abr&eacute;zkov&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> Yes, certainly&nbsp;&hellip; [<i>Turns round and

[<i>Kisses her hand</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> You know that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vous &ecirc;tes toujours le

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> I did, and this is my answer.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> Ah, my friend! I begin quite to
despair. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il est positivement ensorcel&eacute;!</i><a name="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> I never before
knew him so insistent, so obstinate, so pitiless, and so
indifferent to me. He has quite changed since that
woman dismissed her husband!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256">256</a></span>
<span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> What are the facts? How do matters
actually stand?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> He wants to marry her come what
may.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> And how about the husband?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> He agrees to a divorce.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> Dear me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> And he, Victor, lends himself to it,
with all the abominations&mdash;lawyers, proofs of guilt&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout
&ccedil;a est d&eacute;goutant</i>!<a name="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> And it doesn't seem to repel him. I
don't understand him&mdash;he was always so sensitive, so
reserved&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> He is in love! Ah, when a man
really loves&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> Yes, but how is it that in our day
love could be pure&mdash;could be a loving friendship, lasting
through life? That kind of love I understand and value.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> Nowadays the young generation no
longer contents itself with those ideal relations. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La possession

What can one do with him?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> You must not say that of <em>him</em>&mdash;but
it's as if he were under a spell. It's just as if he were
someone else.&hellip; You know, I called on her. He
begged me so. I went there, did not find her in, and
left my card. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Elle m'a fait demander si je ne pourrais la

that is in a few minutes' time, she will be here. I
promised Victor I would receive her, but you understand
how I am placed! I am not myself at all; and so, from
old habit, I sent for you. I need your help!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> This visit of hers, you understand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257">257</a></span>will decide the whole matter&mdash;Victor's fate! I must
either refuse my consent&mdash;but how can I?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> Don't you know her at all?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> I have never seen her. But I'm
afraid of her. A good woman could not consent to leave
her husband, and he a good man, too! As a fellow-student
of Victor's he used to visit us, you know, and
was very nice. But whatever he may be, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><ins title="quels-que">quels que</ins> soient les
torts qu'il a eu vis-&agrave;-vis d'elle</i>,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> one must not leave one's
husband. She ought to bear her cross. What I don't
understand is how Victor, with the convictions he holds,
can think of marrying a divorced woman! How often&mdash;quite
lately&mdash;he has argued warmly with Sp&iacute;tsin in my
presence, that divorce was incompatible with true Christianity;
and now he himself is going in for it! <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Si elle a
pu le charmer &agrave; un tel point</i><a name="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> &hellip; I am afraid of her! But
I sent for you to know what <em>you</em> have to say to it all, and
instead of that I have been doing all the talking myself!
What do you think of it? Tell me your opinion. What
ought I to do? You have spoken with Victor?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> I have: and I think he loves her.
He has grown used to loving her; and love has got a
great hold on him. He is a man who takes things slowly
but firmly. What has once entered his heart will never
leave it again; and he will never love anyone but her;
and he can never be happy without her, or with anyone
else.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> And how willingly V&aacute;rya Kaz&aacute;ntseva
would have married him! What a girl she is, and how
she loves him!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C'est compter sans son h&ocirc;te!</i><a name="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
That is quite out of the question now. I think it's best to
submit, and help him to get married.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258">258</a></span>
<span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> To a divorced woman&mdash;and have him
meet his wife's husband?&hellip; I can't think how you can
speak of it so calmly. Is she a woman a mother could
wish to see as the wife of her only son&mdash;and such a son?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> But what is to be done, my dear
friend? Of course it would be better if he married a
girl whom you knew and liked; but since that's impossible &hellip;
Besides it's not as if he were going to marry a
gipsy, or goodness knows who&nbsp;&hellip;! Lisa Prot&aacute;sova is a
very nice good woman. I know her, through my niece
Nelly, and know her to be a modest, kind-hearted, affectionate
and moral woman.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> A moral woman&mdash;who makes up her
mind to leave her husband!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> This is not like you! You're unkind
and harsh! Her husband is the kind of man of whom
one says that they are their own worst enemies; but he
is an even greater enemy to his wife. He is a weak,
fallen, drunken fellow. He has squandered all his
property and hers too. She has a child.&hellip; How can
you condemn her for leaving such a man? Nor has she
left him: he left her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> Oh, what mud! What mud! And I
have to soil my hands with it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> And how about your religion?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> Of course, of course! To forgive,
&ldquo;As we forgive them that trespass against us.&rdquo; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais,
c'est plus fort <ins title="qui">que</ins> moi!</i><ins title="footnote marker missing in original"><a name="FNanchor_17_17" href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></ins></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> How could she live with such a man?
If she had not loved anyone else she would have had to
leave him. She would have had to, for her child's sake.
The husband himself&mdash;an intelligent kind-hearted man
when he is in his senses&mdash;advises her to do it.&hellip;</p>

<p><i>Enter Victor, who kisses his mother's hand and greets Prince
Abr&eacute;zkov.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259">259</a></span>

subject. For my part, I certainly won't begin.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VICTOR.</span> And she is even less likely to. I only want
you to make her acquaintance.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> The one thing I can't understand is
how you reconcile your desire to marry Mrs. Prot&aacute;sova,
who has a husband living, with your religious conviction
that divorce is contrary to Christianity.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VICTOR.</span> Mother, this is cruel of you! Are we really so
immaculate that we must always be perfectly consistent
when life is so complex? Mother, why are you so cruel
to me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> I love you. I desire your happiness.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VICTOR</span> [<i>to Prince Abr&eacute;zkov</i>] Prince!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> Of course you desire his happiness.
But it is not easy for you and me, with our grey hairs, to
understand the young; and it is particularly difficult for
a mother grown accustomed to her own idea of how her
son is to be happy. Women are all like that.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> Yes, yes indeed! You are all against
me! You may do it, of course. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vous &ecirc;tes majeur.</i><a name="FNanchor_18_18" href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> &hellip;

<p><span class="speaker">VICTOR.</span> You are not yourself. This is worse than
cruelty!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV</span> [<i>to Victor</i>] Be quiet, Victor. Your

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260">260</a></span>

<p><i>Enter Lisa, in visiting dress and hat.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA</span> [<i>rising</i>] I was sorry not to find you in,

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> I never dreamed that you'd be so good as to

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA</span> [<i>pointing to Prince Abr&eacute;zkov</i>] You are

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> Yes, certainly. I have had the

down</i>] My niece Nelly has often mentioned you to me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> Yes, she and I were great friends [<i>glancing timidly
at Anna Dm&iacute;trievna</i>], and we are still friendly. [<i>To Anna
Dm&iacute;trievna</i>] I never expected that you would wish to
see me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> I knew your husband well. He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261">261</a></span>friendly with Victor, and used to come to our house
before he left for Tamb&oacute;v. I think it was there you
married?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> Yes, it was there we married.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> But after his return to Moscow he
never visited us.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> Yes, he hardly went out anywhere.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> And he never introduced you
to me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> The last time I met you was at the

and you were acting.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> No &hellip; Yes &hellip; Of course &hellip; I did act.
[<i>Silence again</i>]. Anna Dm&iacute;trievna, forgive me if what I
am going to say displeases you, but I can't and don't
know how to dissemble! I have come because Victor
Mih&aacute;ylovich said &hellip; because he&mdash;I mean, because
you wished to see me.&hellip; But it is best to speak
out [<i>with a catch in her voice</i>] &hellip; It is very hard for
me.&hellip; But you are kind.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> I'd better go.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> Yes, do.</p>

<p><i>Prince Abr&eacute;zkov takes leave of both women, and exit.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> Listen, Lisa &hellip; I am very sorry
for you, and I like you. But I love Victor. He is the
one being I love in the world. I know his soul as I know
my own. It is a proud soul. He was proud as a boy of
seven.&hellip; Not proud of his name or wealth, but
proud of his character and innocence, which he has
guarded. He is as pure as a maiden.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> I know.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> He has never loved any woman.
You are the first. I do not say I am not jealous. I am
jealous. But we mothers&mdash;your son is still a baby, and
it is too soon for you&mdash;we are prepared for that. I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262">262</a></span>prepared to give him up to his wife and not to be jealous&mdash;but
to a wife as pure as himself&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> I &hellip; have I&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> Forgive me! I know it was not
your fault, but you are unfortunate. And I know him.
Now he is ready to bear&mdash;and will bear&mdash;anything, and
he would never mention it, but he would suffer. His
wounded pride would suffer, and he would not be
happy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> I have thought of that.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> Lisa, my dear, you are a wise and
good woman. If you love him you must desire his
happiness more than your own. And if that is so, you
will not wish to bind him and give him cause to repent&mdash;though
he would never <em>say</em> a word.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> I know he wouldn't! I have thought about it,
and have asked myself that question. I have thought of
it, and have spoken of it to him. But what can I do,
when he says he does not wish to live without me? I
said to him: &ldquo;Let us be friends, but do not spoil your
life; do not bind your pure life to my unfortunate one!&rdquo;
But he does not wish for that.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> No, not at present.&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> Persuade him to leave me, and I will agree. I
love him for his own happiness and not for mine. Only
help me! Do not hate me! Let us lovingly work
together for his happiness!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> Yes, yes! I have grown fond of you.
[<i>Kisses her. Lisa cries</i>] And yet, and yet it is dreadful!
If only he had loved you before you married&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> He says he did love me then, but did not wish
to prevent a friend's happiness.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> Ah, how hard it all is! Still, we
will love one another, and God will help us to find what
we want.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VICTOR</span> [<i>entering</i>] Mother, dear! I have heard everything!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263">263</a></span>I expected this: you are fond of her, and all
will be well!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> I am sorry you heard. I should not have said
it if&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA DM&Iacute;TRIEVNA.</span> Still, nothing is settled. All I can

You're ruining the wench! Oh, but it's wrong &hellip;
You're doing a dirty deed.</p>

<p><i>Enter Prince Abr&eacute;zkov.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> Excuse me. I have been an unwilling
witness of an unpleasant scene.&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266">266</a></span>
<span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> Whom have I the honour?&hellip; [<i>Recognises the
Prince</i>] Ah, Prince Abr&eacute;zkov! [<i>They shake hands</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> An unwilling witness of an unpleasant
scene. I should have been glad not to hear, but
having overheard it, I consider it my duty to tell you so.
I was directed here, and had to wait at the door for those
people to come out&mdash;more particularly as their very loud
voices rendered my knocking inaudible.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> Yes, yes&mdash;please take a seat. Thank you for
telling me: it gives me the right to explain that scene to
you. I don't mind what you may think of me, but I
should like to tell you that the reproaches you heard
addressed to that girl, that gipsy singer, were unjust.
That girl is as morally pure as a dove; and my relations
with her are those of a friend. There may be a tinge of
romance in them, but it does not destroy the purity&mdash;the
honour&mdash;of the girl. That is what I wished to tell you;
but what is it you want of me? In what way can I be
of service?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> In the first place, I&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> Forgive me, Prince. My present social standing
is such, that my former slight acquaintance with you
does not entitle me to a visit from you, unless you have
some business with me. What is it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> I won't deny it. You have guessed
right. I have business with you; but I beg you to
believe that the alteration in your position in no wise
affects my attitude towards you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> I am sure of it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> My business is this. The son of my
old friend, Anna Dm&iacute;trievna Kar&eacute;nina, and she herself,
have asked me to ascertain directly from you what are
your relations &hellip; May I speak out?&hellip; your relations
with your wife, Elisabeth Andr&eacute;yevna Prot&aacute;sova.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> My relations with my wife, or rather with her
who <em>was</em> my wife, are entirely at an end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267">267</a></span>
<span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> So I understood, and that is why I
accepted this difficult mission.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> At an end, and, I hasten to add, not by her
fault, but by mine&mdash;by my innumerable faults. She is,
as she always was, quite irreproachable.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> Well then, Victor Kar&eacute;nin, or rather
his mother, asked me to find out what your intentions
are.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA</span> [<i>growing excited</i>] What intentions? I have none.
I set her quite free! Moreover, I will never disturb her
peace. I know she loves Victor Kar&eacute;nin. Well, let
her! I consider him a very dull, but very good and
honourable man, and I think that she will, as the phrase
goes, be happy with him; and&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">que le bon Dieu les
b&eacute;nisse</i>!<a name="FNanchor_20_20" href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> That's all&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> Yes, but we&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA</span> [<i>interrupting</i>] And don't suppose that I feel the
least bit jealous. If I said that Victor is dull, I withdraw
the remark. He is an excellent, honourable, moral man:
almost the direct opposite of myself. And he has loved
her from childhood. Perhaps she too may have loved
him when she married me&mdash;that happens sometimes!
The very best love is unconscious love. I believe she
always did love him; but as an honest woman she did
not confess it even to herself. But &hellip; a shadow of
some kind always lay across our family life&mdash;but why am
I confessing to you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> Please do! Believe me, my chief
reason for coming to you was my desire to understand
the situation fully.&hellip; I understand you. I understand
that the shadow, as you so well express it, may
have been&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> Yes, it was; and that perhaps is why I could
not find satisfaction in the family life she provided for
me, but was always seeking something, and being carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268">268</a></span>away. However, that sounds like excusing myself. I
don't want to, and can't, excuse myself. I was (I say
with assurance, <em>was</em>) a bad husband. I say <em>was</em>, because
in my consciousness I am not, and have long not been,
her husband. I consider her perfectly free. So there
you have my answer to your question.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> Yes, but you know Victor's family,
and himself too. His relation to Elisabeth Andr&eacute;yevna
is, and has been all through, most respectful and distant.
He assisted her when she was in trouble&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> Yes, I by my dissipation helped to draw them
together. What's to be done? It had to be so!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> You know the strictly Orthodox convictions
of that family. Having myself a broader outlook
on things, I do not share them; but I respect and understand
them. I understand that for him, and especially
for his mother, union with a woman without a Church
marriage is unthinkable.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> Yes, I know his stu&nbsp;&hellip; his strictness, his
conservatism in these matters. But what do they want?
A divorce? I told them long ago that I am quite willing;
but the business of taking the blame on myself, and all
the lies connected with it, are very trying.&hellip;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> I quite understand you, and sympathise.
But how can it be avoided? I think it might be
arranged that way&mdash;but you are right. It is dreadful,
and I quite understand you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA</span> [<i>pressing the Prince's hand</i>] Thank you, dear
Prince! I always knew you were a kind and honourable
man. Tell me what to do. How am I to act? Put
yourself in my place. I am not trying to improve. I
am a good-for-nothing; but there are things I cannot do
quietly. I cannot quietly tell lies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269">269</a></span>
<span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> I don't understand you! You, a
capable, intelligent man, so sensitive to what is good&mdash;how
can you let yourself be so carried away&mdash;so forget
what you expect of yourself? How have you ruined
your life and come to this?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA</span> [<i>forcing back tears of emotion</i>] I have led this
disorderly life for ten years, and this is the first time a
man like you has pitied me! I have been pitied by my
boon-companions, by rakes and by women; but a reasonable,
good man like you &hellip; Thank you! How did I
come to my ruin? First, through drink. It is not that
drink tastes nice; but do what I will, I always feel I am
not doing the right thing, and I feel ashamed. I talk to
you now, and feel ashamed. As for being a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mar&eacute;chal de
la noblesse</i>, or a Bank Director&mdash;I should feel ashamed, so
ashamed! It is only when I drink that I do not feel this
shame. And music: not operas or Beethoven, but
gipsies!&hellip; That is life! Energy flows into one's
veins! And then those dear black eyes, and those
smiles! And the more delicious it is, the more ashamed
one feels afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCE ABR&Eacute;ZKOV.</span> How about work?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> I have tried it, but it's no good. I am always
dissatisfied with it&mdash;but what's the use of talking about

I'll bring some paper directly.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">IV&Aacute;N PETR&Oacute;VICH.</span> You wish to reply to their demands?
I'll tell you what to say. I should not do it that way&mdash;always

Wait a bit!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">IV&Aacute;N PETR&Oacute;VICH.</span> What's that? Do you want to shoot
yourself? You can if you like. I understand you!
They wish to humiliate you, and you will show them the
sort of man you are! You will kill yourself with a
revolver, and them with magnanimity. I understand you.
I understand everything, because I am a genius.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> Of course&mdash;of course. Only&nbsp;&hellip; [<i>Enter waiter

<p><span class="speaker">IV&Aacute;N PETR&Oacute;VICH.</span> Here's to your &hellip; great journey!
You know I'm above all this. I'm not going to restrain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272">272</a></span>you! Life and death are alike to Genius. I die in life,
and live in death. You will kill yourself that two people
should pity you; and I&mdash;I shall kill myself that the whole
world may understand what it has lost. I won't hesitate,
or think about it! I seize it [<i>snatches revolver</i>]&mdash;now!
And all is over. But it is too soon yet. [<i>Lays down
revolver</i>] Nor shall I write anything; they must understand
it themselves.&hellip; Oh, you&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA</span> [<i>writing</i>] Wait a bit.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">IV&Aacute;N PETR&Oacute;VICH.</span> Pitiful people! They fuss, they
bustle, and don't understand&mdash;don't understand anything
at all.&hellip; I'm not talking to you, I am only expressing
my thoughts. And, after all, what does humanity need?
Very little&mdash;only to value its geniuses. But they always
are executed, persecuted, tortured.&hellip; No! I'm not
going to be your toy! I will drag you out into the open!
No-o-o! Hypocrites!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA</span> [<i>having finished writing, drinks and reads over his

<p><span class="speaker">IV&Aacute;N PETR&Oacute;VICH.</span> Go away? Well, good-bye then! I
am not going to restrain you. I shall do the same. But
not yet. I only want to tell you&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> All right! You'll tell me afterwards. And
now, dear chap, just one thing: give this to the manager
[<i>gives him money</i>] and ask if a parcel and a letter have
come for me.&hellip; Please do!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">IV&Aacute;N PETR&Oacute;VICH.</span> All right&mdash;then you'll wait for me? I
have still something important to tell you&mdash;something that
you will not hear in this world nor in the next, at any rate
not till I come there.&hellip; Am I to let him have <em>all</em> of this?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> As much as is necessary. [<i>Exit Iv&aacute;n Petr&oacute;vich.</i>]</p>

<p><i>F&eacute;dya sighs with relief; locks the door behind Iv&aacute;n Petr&oacute;vich;

[<i>M&aacute;sha's voice from outside</i>] It's me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> Who's &ldquo;me&rdquo;? Oh, M&aacute;sha&nbsp;&hellip; [<i>opens door</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">M&Aacute;SHA.</span> I've been to your place, to Pop&oacute;v's, to Afr&eacute;mov's,
and guessed that you must be here. [<i>Sees revolver</i>] That's
a nice thing! There's a fool! A regular fool! Is it
possible you really meant to?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> No, I couldn't.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">M&Aacute;SHA.</span> Do I count for nothing at all? You heathen!
You had no pity for me? Oh, Theodore Vas&iacute;lyevich,
it's a sin, a sin! In return for my love&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> I wished to release them. I promised to, and
I can't lie.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">M&Aacute;SHA.</span> And what about me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> What about you? It would have set you free
too. Is it better for you to be tormented by me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">M&Aacute;SHA.</span> Seems it's better. I can't live without you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> What sort of life could you have with me?
You'd have cried a bit, and then gone on living your
own life.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">M&Aacute;SHA.</span> I shouldn't have cried at all! Go to the devil,
if you don't pity me! [<i>Cries</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> M&aacute;sha, dearest! I meant to do it for the best.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">M&Aacute;SHA.</span> Best for yourself!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA</span> [<i>smiles</i>] How's that, when I meant to kill
myself?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">M&Aacute;SHA.</span> Of course, best for yourself! But what is it
you want? Tell me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> What I want? I want a great deal.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">M&Aacute;SHA.</span> Well, what? What?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> First of all, to keep my promise. That is the
first thing, and quite sufficient. To lie, and do all the
dirty work necessary to get a divorce &hellip; I can't!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">M&Aacute;SHA.</span> Granted that it's horrid&mdash;I myself&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> Next, they must really be free&mdash;my wife and
he. After all, they are good people; and why should
they suffer? That's the second thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274">274</a></span>
<span class="speaker">M&Aacute;SHA.</span> Well, there isn't much good in her, if she's
thrown you over.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> She didn't&mdash;I threw her over.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">M&Aacute;SHA.</span> All right, all right! It's always you. She is an

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> This&mdash;that you are a good, dear girlie&mdash;and
that I love you, and if I live I shall ruin you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">M&Aacute;SHA.</span> That's not your business. I know quite well
what will ruin me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA</span> [<i>sighs</i>] But above all, above all &hellip; What use
is my life? Don't I know that I am a lost good-for-nothing?
I am a burden to myself and to everybody&mdash;as
your father said. I'm worthless.&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">M&Aacute;SHA.</span> What rubbish! I shall stick to you. I've
stuck to you already, and there's an end of it! As to
your leading a bad life, drinking and going on the spree&mdash;well,
you're a living soul! Give it up, and have done
with it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> That's easily said.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">M&Aacute;SHA.</span> Well, then, do it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> Yes, when I look at you I feel as if I could
really do anything.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">M&Aacute;SHA.</span> And so you shall! Yes, you'll do it! [<i>Sees
the letter</i>] What's that? You've written to them? What
have you written?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> What have I written?&hellip; [<i>Takes the letter and
is about to tear it up</i>] It's no longer wanted now.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">M&Aacute;SHA</span> [<i>snatches the letter</i>] You've said you would kill
yourself? Yes? You did not mention the revolver&mdash;only
said that you'd kill yourself?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> Yes, that I should be no more.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">M&Aacute;SHA.</span> Give it me&mdash;give it, give it!&hellip; Have you
read <cite>What to Do</cite>?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> I think I have.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">M&Aacute;SHA.</span> It's a tiresome novel, but there's one very, very
good thing in it. That what's his name?&mdash;Rakhm&aacute;nov&mdash;goes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275">275</a></span>and pretends he has drowned himself. And you&mdash;can
you swim?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">M&Aacute;SHA.</span> That's all right. Let me have your clothes&mdash;everything,
and your pocket-book too.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> How can I?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">M&Aacute;SHA.</span> Wait a bit, wait, wait! Let's go home; then
you'll change your clothes.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> But it will be a fraud.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">M&Aacute;SHA.</span> All right! You go to bathe, your clothes
remain on the bank, in the pocket is your pocket-book
and this letter.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> Yes, and then?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">M&Aacute;SHA.</span> And then? Why, then we'll go off together
and live gloriously.</p>

<p><i>Enter Iv&aacute;n Petr&oacute;vich.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> He promised so definitely, that I am sure he
will keep his word.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> I am ashamed to say it, but I must confess that
what I heard about that gipsy girl makes me feel quite
free. Don't think it is jealousy; it isn't, but you know&mdash;it
sets me free. I hardly know how to tell you.&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> You don't know how to tell me &hellip; Why?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA</span> [<i>smiling</i>] Never mind! Only let me explain what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276">276</a></span>I feel. The chief thing that tormented me was, that I
felt I loved two men; and that meant that I was an
immoral woman.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> <em>You</em> immoral?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> But since I knew that he had got someone else,
and that he therefore did not need me, I felt free, and
felt that I might truthfully say that I love you. Now
things are clear within me, and only my position torments
me. This divorce! It is such torture&mdash;and then this
waiting!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> It will soon, very soon, be settled. Besides
his promise, I sent my secretary to him with the petition
ready for signature, and told him not to leave till it is
signed. If I did not know him so well, I should think
he was purposely behaving as he does.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> He? No, it is the result both of his weakness
and his honesty. He doesn't want to say what is not
true. Only you were wrong to send him money.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> I had to. The want of it might be the cause
of the delay.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> No, there is something bad about money.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> Well, anyhow, <em>he</em> need not have been so
punctilious&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> How selfish we are becoming!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> Yes, I confess it. It's your own fault. After
all that waiting, that hopelessness, I am now so happy!
And happiness makes one selfish. It's your fault!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> Do you think it's you only? I too&mdash;I feel full of
happiness, bathed in bliss! I have everything&mdash;M&iacute;sha
has recovered, your mother likes me, and you&mdash;and above
all, I, I love!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> Yes? And no repenting? No turning back?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> Since that day everything has changed in me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> And will not change again?</p>

<i>Enter nurse, with baby. Lisa takes the baby on her lap.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> What wretched people we are!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA</span> [<i>kissing baby</i>] Why?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> When you married, and I heard of it on my
return from abroad, and was wretched because I felt that
I had lost you, it was a relief to me to find that you still
remembered me. I was content even with that. Then
when our friendship was established and I felt your
kindness to me, and even a little gleam of something in
our friendship that was more than friendship, I was
almost happy. I was only tormented by a fear that I
was not being honest towards F&eacute;dya. But no! I was
always so firmly conscious that any other relation than
one of purest friendship with my friend's wife was
impossible&mdash;besides which, I knew you&mdash;that I was not
really troubled about that. Afterwards, when F&eacute;dya
began to cause you anxiety, and I felt that I was of some
use to you, and that my friendship was beginning to
alarm you&mdash;I was quite happy, and a sort of vague hope
awoke in me. Still later, when he became altogether
impossible and you decided to leave him, and I spoke
to you plainly for the first time, and you did not say
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; but went away in tears&mdash;then I was perfectly
happy; and had I then been asked what more I wanted,
I should have answered &ldquo;Nothing&rdquo;! But later on, when
there came the possibility of uniting our lives: when my
mother grew fond of you and the possibility began to be
realised; when you told me that you loved and had
loved me, and then (as you did just now) that he no
longer existed for you and that you love only me&mdash;what
more, one would think, could I wish for? But no! Now
the past torments me! I wish that past had not existed,
and that there were nothing to remind me of it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA</span> [<i>reproachfully</i>] Victor!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> Lisa, forgive me! If I tell you this, it is only
because I don't want a single thought of mine about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278">278</a></span>you to be hidden from you. I have purposely told you,
to show how bad I am, and how well I know that I must
struggle with and conquer myself.&hellip; And now I've
done it! I love him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> That's as it should be. I did all I could, but it
was not I that did what you desired: it happened in my
heart, from which everything but you has vanished.</p>

<h2>ACT V</h2>


<h3 class="smcap">Scene 1</h3>

<p class="scene">A dirty room in a low-class restaurant. A table, at which
people sit drinking tea and v&oacute;dka. In the foreground a small
table, at which sits F&eacute;dya, tattered, and much come down in the
world. With him is Petushk&oacute;v, a gentle, mild man with long
hair, of clerical appearance. Both are slightly drunk.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETUSHK&Oacute;V.</span> I understand, I understand. That is true
love! Yes? Go on.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> Well, you know, if a woman of our class showed
such feeling and sacrificed everything for the man she
loved.&hellip; But she was a gipsy, brought up to money-hunting,
and yet she had this self-sacrificing love! Gave
everything, and wanted nothing herself! The contrast
was so wonderful!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETUSHK&Oacute;V.</span> Yes, in art we call it &ldquo;value.&rdquo; You can
only get quite bright red by putting green round it.
But that's not to the point. I understand, quite understand.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> Yes, and I believe the one good action of my
life is that I never took advantage of her love. And do
you know why?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETUSHK&Oacute;V.</span> Pity.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> Oh no! I never felt pity for her. What I felt
for her was always rapturous admiration&mdash;and when she
sang! Ah, how she sang&mdash;and perhaps still sings! I
always regarded her as far above me. I did not ruin her,
simply because I loved her; loved her truly. And now
she's a good, happy memory! [<i>Drinks</i>].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282">282</a></span>
<span class="speaker">PETUSHK&Oacute;V.</span> Yes, I understand, I understand. It's
ideal.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> I'll tell you something. I have had my
passions, and once I was in love with a lady&mdash;very
handsome&mdash;and I loved her nastily, like a dog. She
gave me a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rendezvous</i>. And I did not go, because I
thought it was treating the husband shabbily. And it is
strange that, even now, when I remember it I want to
feel pleased and to approve of myself for having acted
honourably, but I always repent as if I had committed a
sin! But in the case of M&aacute;sha, on the contrary, I am
always pleased&mdash;pleased that I did not pollute that
feeling of mine.&hellip; I may fall lower still, sell all I
have on me, be covered with lice and sores&mdash;but this
jewel &hellip; no, not jewel, but ray of sunshine, is still with
me and in me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETUSHK&Oacute;V.</span> I understand, I understand! And where is
she now?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> I don't know! And I'd rather not know. All
<em>that</em> belonged to a different life; and I don't want to mix
it up with this.&hellip;</p>

<p><i>A woman is heard screaming at a table behind. The
manager and a policeman come in and take her out. F&eacute;dya
and Petushk&oacute;v listen, and look on in silence. When all is
quiet again,</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETUSHK&Oacute;V.</span> Yes, your life is astonishing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> No, it's most simple! You know, in the society
in which I was born there are only three careers open to
a man&mdash;only three. The first is to enter the civil or
military service, to earn money and increase the abominations
amid which we live. That was repulsive to me.
Perhaps I had not the capacity for it; but above all it
repelled me. Then the second is to destroy those
abominations. To do that you must be a hero; and I
am not a hero. And the third is to forget it all by
going on the spree, drinking and singing. That is what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283">283</a></span>I did. And this is what my singing has brought me
to! [<i>Drinks</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETUSHK&Oacute;V.</span> And what about family life? I should be
happy if I had a wife. My wife ruined me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> Family life? Yes, my wife was an ideal
woman. She is still living. But how shall I tell you?
There was no yeast in it&mdash;you know, the yeast that
makes the beer froth! Well, there was nothing of that in
our life: it was flat, and I wanted something to help me
to forget&mdash;and one can't forget when there's no sparkle in
life. Then I began to do all sorts of nasty things. And
you know, we love people for the good we do them, and
dislike them for the harm we do them; and I did her
much harm. She seemed to love me&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETUSHK&Oacute;V.</span> Why do you say &ldquo;seemed&rdquo;?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> I say it because there was never anything about
her that made her creep into my soul as M&aacute;sha did. But
that's not what I meant to say. When she was pregnant,
or nursing her baby, I used to vanish, and come home
drunk; and of course, just because of that, I loved her
less and less. Yes, yes! [<i>in ecstasy</i>] I have it! The reason
I love M&aacute;sha is that I did her good and not harm.
That's why I love her. The other one I tormented, and
therefore I don't like her.&hellip; No, after all, I simply
don't like her! Was I jealous? Yes, but that too is
past.&hellip;</p>

<p><i>Enter Art&eacute;myev, with a cockade on his cap, dyed moustaches,
and old renovated clothes.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">ART&Eacute;MYEV.</span> Wish you a good appetite! [<i>Bows to F&eacute;dya</i>]
I see you've made acquaintance with our painter, our artist.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA</span> [<i>coldly</i>] Yes, we are acquainted.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ART&Eacute;MYEV</span> [<i>to Petushk&oacute;v</i>] And have you finished the
portrait?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETUSHK&Oacute;V.</span> No, I lost the order.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ART&Eacute;MYEV</span> [<i>Sits down</i>] I'm not in your way?</p>

<p><i>F&eacute;dya and Petushk&oacute;v do not answer.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284">284</a></span>
<span class="speaker">PETUSHK&Oacute;V.</span> Theodore Vas&iacute;lyevich was telling me
about his life.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ART&Eacute;MYEV.</span> Secrets? Then I won't disturb you&mdash;go
on? I'm sure I don't want you. Swine! [<i>Goes to next
table and calls for beer. He listens all the time to F&eacute;dya's
conversation with Petushk&oacute;v, and leans towards them without
their noticing</i> <ins title="it."><i>it.</i>]</ins></p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> I don't like that gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETUSHK&Oacute;V.</span> He was offended.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> Well, let him be! I can't stand him. He is
such a fellow, my words won't come when he is there.
Now with you I feel at ease, and comfortable. Well,
what was I saying?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETUSHK&Oacute;V.</span> You were speaking about your jealousy.
And how was it you parted from your wife?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> Ah! [<i>Pauses and considers</i>] It's a curious
story. My wife is married&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETUSHK&Oacute;V.</span> How's that? Are you divorced?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA</span> [<i>smiles</i>] No, I left her a widow.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETUSHK&Oacute;V.</span> What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> I mean that she's a widow! I don't exist.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETUSHK&Oacute;V.</span> Don't exist?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> No, I'm a corpse! Yes&nbsp;&hellip; [<i>Art&eacute;myev leans
over, listening</i>] Well, you see&mdash;I <em>can</em> tell <em>you</em> about it;
and besides, it happened long ago; and you don't know
my real name. It was this way. When I had tired out
my wife and had squandered everything I could lay my
hands on, and had become unbearable, a protector turned
up for her. Don't imagine that there was anything dirty
or bad about it&mdash;no, he was my friend and a very good
fellow&mdash;only in everything my exact opposite! And as
there is far more evil than good in me, it follows that he
was a good&mdash;a very good man: honourable, firm, self-restrained
and, in a word, virtuous. He had known my
wife from her childhood, and loved her. When she
married me he resigned himself to his fate. But later,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285">285</a></span>when I became horrid and tormented her, he began to
come oftener to our house. I myself wished it. They
fell in love with one another, and meanwhile I went
altogether to the bad, and abandoned my wife of my own
accord. And besides, there was M&aacute;sha. I myself advised
them to marry. They did not want to, but I
became more and more impossible, and it ended in&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETUSHK&Oacute;V.</span> The usual thing?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> No. I am sure; I know for certain that they
remained pure. He is a religious man, and considers
marriage without the Church's blessing a sin. So they
began asking me to agree to a divorce. I should have
had to take the blame on myself. It would have been
necessary to tell all sorts of lies &hellip; and I couldn't!
Believe me, it would have been easier for me to take my
life than to tell such lies&mdash;and I wished to do so. But
then a kind friend came and said, &ldquo;Why do it?&rdquo; and
arranged it all for me. I wrote a farewell letter, and
next day my clothes, pocket-book and letters were found
on the river bank. I can't swim.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETUSHK&Oacute;V.</span> Yes, but how about the body? They did
not find that!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> They did! Fancy! A week later somebody's
body was found. My wife was called to identify the decomposing
body. She just glanced at it. &ldquo;Is it he?&rdquo;
&ldquo;It is.&rdquo; And so it was left. I was buried, and they
married and are living in this town, happily. And I&mdash;here
I am, living and drinking! Yesterday I passed
their house. The windows were lit up, and someone's
shadow crossed the blind. Sometimes it's horrid, and
sometimes not. It's horrid when I've no money&nbsp;&hellip;
[<i>Drinks</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ART&Eacute;MYEV</span> [<i>approaches</i>] Excuse me, but I heard your
story. It's a very good story, and more than that&mdash;a
very useful one! You say it's horrid when one has no
money? There's nothing more horrid. But you, in your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286">286</a></span>position, should always have money. Aren't you a corpse?
Well then&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> Excuse me! I did not speak to you and don't
want your advice.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ART&Eacute;MYEV.</span> But I want to give it! You are a corpse;
but suppose you come to life again? Then they, your
wife and that gentleman, who are so happy&mdash;they would
be bigamists, and at best would be sent to the less distant
parts of Siberia. So why should you lack money?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> I beg you to leave me alone.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ART&Eacute;MYEV.</span> Simply write a letter. I'll write it for you
if you like; only give me their address, and you'll be
grateful to me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> Be off, I tell you! I have told you nothing!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ART&Eacute;MYEV.</span> Yes, you have! Here's my witness. The
waiter heard you say you were a corpse.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">WAITER.</span> I know nothing about it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> You scoundrel!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ART&Eacute;MYEV.</span> Am I a scoundrel? Eh, police! I'll give
him in charge!</p>

<p><i>F&eacute;dya rises to go, but Art&eacute;myev holds him. Enter policeman.</i></p>

simply can't think of him without tears.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Yes, I am sure of it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> Yes, it's a nasty affair. It's true
I am only beginning to look into it, but it's a bad business.
Well, good-bye! [<i>Exit M&eacute;lnikov</i>].</p>

<p><i>Enter Lisa, in black and veiled.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> Take a seat, please. [<i>Points to
a chair</i>] Believe me, I much regret to have to question
you, but we are under the necessity &hellip; Please be calm,
and remember that you need not answer my questions.
Only, in my opinion, for your own sake&mdash;and in fact for
everybody's sake&mdash;the truth is best. It is always best,
even practically.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> I have nothing to conceal.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> Well then [<i>looks at paper</i>]&mdash;your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291">291</a></span>name, position, religion&mdash;all that I have put down. Is it
correct?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> You are accused of contracting
a marriage with another man, knowing your husband to
be alive.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> I did not know it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> And also of having persuaded
your husband, and bribed him with money, to commit
a fraud&mdash;a pretended suicide&mdash;in order to free yourself
of him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> That is all untrue.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> Well then, allow me to put a
few questions. Did you send him 1,200 roubles in July
of last year?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> It was his own money, the proceeds of the sale of
some things of his. At the time I parted from him, and
when I was expecting a divorce, I sent him the money.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> Just so! Very well. That
money was sent to him on the 17th of July, two days
before his disappearance?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> I think it was on the 17th, but I don't remember.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> And why was the application to
the Consistorium for a divorce withdrawn, just at that
time&mdash;and the lawyer told not to proceed with the case?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> Well, and when the police
asked you to identify the body, how was it you recognised
it as your husband's?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> I was so excited that I did not look at the body,
and I felt so sure it was he, that when they asked me I
answered, &ldquo;I think it is he.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> Yes, you did not see well, in
consequence of a very natural excitement. And now may
I ask why you have sent a monthly remittance to Sar&aacute;tov,
the very town where your first husband was living?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292">292</a></span>
<span class="speaker">LISA.</span> My husband sent that money, and I cannot say
what it was for, as that is not my secret. But it was not
sent to Theodore Vas&iacute;lyevich, for we were firmly convinced
of his death. That I can say for certain.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> Very well. Only allow me to
remark, madam, that the fact of our being servants of the
law does not prevent our being men; and believe me I
quite understand your position and sympathise with you!
You were tied to a man who squandered your property,
was unfaithful&mdash;in short, brought misfortune.&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> I loved him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> Yes; but still the desire to free
yourself was natural, and you chose this simpler way,
without realising that it would lead you into what is
considered a crime&mdash;bigamy! I quite understand it.
The judges will understand too; and therefore I advise
you to confess everything.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> I have nothing to confess. I have never lied.
[<i>Cries</i>] Do you want me any longer?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> I must ask you to remain here.
I will not trouble you with any more questions. Only
kindly read this over and sign it. It is your deposition.
See whether your answers have been correctly taken down.
Please take that seat. [<i>Points to an armchair by the window.
To Clerk</i>] Ask Mr. Kar&eacute;nin to come in.</p>

<p><i>Enter Kar&eacute;nin, stern and solemn.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> Please take a seat.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> Thank you! [<i>Remains standing</i>] What do you
want of me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> I have to take your deposition.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> In what capacity?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293">293</a></span>
<span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE</span> [<i>smiling</i>] I, in the capacity of
Examining Magistrate, am obliged to question you in the
capacity of an accused person.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> Indeed! Accused of what?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> Of marrying a woman whose
husband was alive. However, allow me to question you
properly. Kindly sit down.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> Your name?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> Victor Kar&eacute;nin.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> Your calling?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> Chamberlain and Member of Council.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> Age?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> Thirty-eight.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> Religion?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> Orthodox; and I have never before been
tried or questioned! Well?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> Did you know that Theodore
Vas&iacute;lyevich Prot&aacute;sov was alive when you married his wife?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> I did not know it. We were both convinced
that he was drowned.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> After Prot&aacute;sov's alleged death,
to whom in Sar&aacute;tov did you send a monthly remittance?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> I do not wish to reply to that question.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> Very well. Why did you send
money&mdash;1,200 roubles&mdash;to Mr. Prot&aacute;sov just before his
pretended death on 17th July?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> That money was given to me by my wife&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> By Mrs. Prot&aacute;sova?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> &hellip;&nbsp;by my wife, to send to her husband.
She considered that money to be his, and having severed
all connection with him, considered it unfair to keep it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> One more question&mdash;why did
you withdraw the application for divorce?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> Because Theodore Vas&iacute;lyevich undertook to
apply for a divorce, and wrote me about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294">294</a></span>
<span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> Have you got his letter?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> It has been lost.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> It is strange that everything
which might convince the Court of the truth of your
evidence should either be lost or non-existent.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> Do you want anything more?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> I want nothing, except to do
my duty; but you'll have to exonerate yourselves, and
I have just advised Mrs. Prot&aacute;sova, and I advise you also,
not to try to hide what everyone can see, but to say what
really happened. Especially as Mr. Prot&aacute;sov is in such
a condition that he has already told everything just as it
happened, and will probably do the same in Court, I
should advise&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> I request you to keep within the limits of your
duty, and not to give me your advice! May we go?
[<i>Approaches Lisa, who rises and takes his arm</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> I am very sorry to be obliged
to detain you&nbsp;&hellip; [<i>Kar&eacute;nin looks round in astonishment</i>]
Oh, I don't mean that I arrest you. Though that would
make it easier to get at the truth, I shall not resort to
such a measure. I only want to take Prot&aacute;sov's deposition
in your presence, and to confront him with you&mdash;which
will make it easier for you to detect any falsehood
in what he says. Please take a seat. Call in Mr.
Prot&aacute;sov!</p>

<p><i>Enter F&eacute;dya, dirty and shabby.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA</span> [<i>addresses Lisa and Kar&eacute;nin</i>] Lisa! Elisabeth
Andr&eacute;yevna! Victor! I am not guilty! I wished to
act for the best. But if I am guilty &hellip; forgive me,
forgive me! [<i>Bows low to them</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> Please to answer my questions.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> Ask, then.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> Your name?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295">295</a></span>
<span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> Why, you know it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> Please answer.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> Well then, Theodore Prot&aacute;sov.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> Your calling, age and religion?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA</span> [<i>after a pause</i>] Aren't you ashamed to ask such
nonsense? Ask what you want to know, and not such
rubbish!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> I beg you to be more careful in
your expressions, and to answer my questions!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> Well, if you're not ashamed of it, here you are:
Calling, graduate; age, forty; religion, Orthodox. What
next!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> Did Mr. Kar&eacute;nin and your wife
know that you were alive when you left your clothes on
the river bank and disappeared?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> Certainly not! I wished really to commit
suicide, but afterwards&mdash;but there's no need to go into
that. The thing is, that they knew nothing about it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> How is it that you gave a
different account to the police officer?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> What police officer? Oh, when he came to see
me at the dosshouse? I was drunk, and was romancing.
I don't remember what I said. All that was rubbish.
Now I am not drunk, and am telling the whole truth!
They knew nothing. They believed that I was no longer
alive, and I was glad of it. And everything would have
gone on as it was, but for that rascal, Art&eacute;myev! If
anyone is guilty, it is I alone.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> I understand your wish to be
magnanimous, but the law demands the truth. Why
was money sent to you?</p>

<p><i>F&eacute;dya is silent.</i></p>

<p>You received through Semy&oacute;nov the money sent to
you in Sar&aacute;tov?</p>

<p><i>F&eacute;dya is silent.</i></p>

<p>Why don't you answer? It will be put down in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296">296</a></span>depositions that the accused did not answer these
questions, and this may harm you and them very much.
Well then, how was it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA</span> [<i>after a pause</i>] Oh, Mr. Magistrate, how is it
you are not ashamed! Why do you pry into other
people's lives? You are glad to have power, and to show
it, you torment not physically but morally&mdash;torment
people a thousand times better than yourself!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> I beg&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> You've nothing to beg! I shall say what I
think, and you [<i>to Clerk</i>] write it down! At least for
once there will be sensible human words in a police
report! [<i>Raises his voice</i>] There are three people: I, he,
and she. Our relations to one another are complex&mdash;a
spiritual struggle such as you know nothing of, a struggle
between good and evil goes on. That struggle ends in a
manner which sets them free. They were all at peace.
They were happy, and remembered me with affection.
I, fallen as I was, was glad that I had acted as I ought,
and that I, a good-for-nothing, had gone out of their
lives, so as not to stand in the way of people who were
good and who had life before them. And so we were all
living, when suddenly a blackmailing scoundrel appears
who wants me to take part in his rascality, and I send
him about his business. Then he comes to you, to the
champion of Justice! The guardian of Morality! And
you, who receive each month a few pounds for doing
your dirty work, put on your uniform, and calmly bully
these people&mdash;bully people whose little finger is worth
more than your whole body and soul! People who would
not admit you to their anteroom! But you have got so
far, and are pleased&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> I shall have you turned out!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> I'm not afraid of anyone, because I'm a corpse
and you can't do me any harm. No position could be
worse than mine! So turn me out!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297">297</a></span>
<span class="speaker">KAR&Eacute;NIN.</span> May we go?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> Immediately, but first sign your
deposition.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">F&Eacute;DYA.</span> You'd be quite comic, if you weren't so vile!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">EXAMINING MAGISTRATE.</span> Take him away! I arrest you.</p>
